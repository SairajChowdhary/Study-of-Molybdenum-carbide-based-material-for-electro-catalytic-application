Key Features
Polymer Derived Ceramics (PDCs): The project explores the use of Polymer Derived Ceramics (PDCs), a class of materials known for their exceptional thermal and chemical stability. The synthesis route from pre-ceramic polymers like polysilazanes is a key aspect of this research.

Molybdenum-Carbide Catalyst: The core of the project is the study of Molybdenum-Carbide. Its unique electronic structure, similar to platinum, and high conductivity make it a viable alternative to traditional precious metal catalysts.

# Advanced Ceramic Supports: 
The project also investigates the use of robust ceramic supports like SiCN and SiOC to enhance the performance and stability of the catalyst.

# Experimental Analysis: 
The work includes a detailed analysis of the synthesised materials using techniques such as X-ray Diffraction (XRD) and Raman Spectroscopy to understand the material's properties and catalytic activity.

# Future Work: 
The project outlines future research directions, including further synthesis and investigation of the polymer precursor and the fabrication of a working electrode for performance testing.
